# Testing

## Test Runner (nextest)

The default test runner works fine, but it is notably slower and less fully featured than [nextest].

Fortunately, [nextest] ships with the nix-shell, so assuming you have already followed the
instructions in the [README.md], you should be able to run

```shell
cargo nextest run
```

even if you have not installed [nextest] on your system.

> [!WARNING]
> [nextest profiles] are not the same thing as [cargo profiles].
> If you want to select a cargo profile when running [nextest], use, for example

```shell
cargo nextest run --cargo-profile=release
```

## Code Coverage (llvm-cov)

The nix-shell also ships with [cargo llvm-cov] for collecting
[code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) information.
Assuming you have followed the [README.md], you should be able to run

```shell
just coverage
```

to get code coverage information.

Code coverage reports from CI are uploaded to [our codecov page](https://app.codecov.io/gh/githedgehog/dataplane).

If you wish to study coverage data locally, you can run

```shell
just coverage
cd ./target/nextest/coverage/html
python3 -m http.server
```

And then open a web-browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view coverage data.

## Fuzz testing (bolero)

The dataplane project makes fairly extensive use of [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).
We use the [bolero] crate for our fuzz tests.

Running the test suite via `cargo test` or `cargo nextest run` will run the fuzz tests.

- The tests (even the fuzz tests) are only run briefly.
- Coverage information and sanitizers are not enabled.
- A full fuzzing engine is not set up, so evolutionary feedback is not provided when the tests are run this way,

Using [libfuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) or [afl](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus) can
change this.

The major downside is that these processes are very computationally intensive and can take a long time to run.
In fact, the [afl] fuzzer runs until you terminate it.

To run a full fuzz test, start by listing the available fuzz targets:

```shell
just list-fuzz-tests
```

Then pick a target, e.g. `vxlan::test::mutation_of_header_preserves_contract`, and run `libfuzzer` like so

```shell
just fuzz vxlan::test::mutation_of_header_preserves_contract
```

The test will run for 1 minute by default, but you can change to, e.g., 15 minutes via

```shell
just fuzz vxlan::test::mutation_of_header_preserves_contract -T 15min
```

> [!NOTE]
> The fuzz tests are run with full optimizations and extensive debugging information, so expect a fairly long compile
> time.
